# For SSDP discovery to work in Docker bridge networks, you need to use
# dual-network setup with macvlan. Example configuration:

# services:
#   stream-to-dlna:
#     networks:
#       your-macvlan-network:
#         ipv4_address: 192.168.x.x  # Choose free IP in your LAN
#       your-npm-bridge:
#         ipv4_address: 172.x.x.x    # Choose free IP in bridge
#
# networks:
#   your-macvlan-network:
#     external: true
